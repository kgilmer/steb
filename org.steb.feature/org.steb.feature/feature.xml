      Shell to Linux Bridge (steb) allows for easy shell integration
with Eclipse.  Rather than toil with workspaces and File-&gt;Open...
drugery, launch an Eclipse editor on the command line as you
would vi or emacs.  Here is the client side script (also included
in the plugin) to execute from the shell:

#!/bin/bash
touch $1
realpath $1 | nc localhost 4404
