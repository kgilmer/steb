Shell to Linux Bridge (steb) allows for easy shell integration
with Eclipse.  Rather than toil with workspaces and File->Open...
drugery, launch an Eclipse editor on the command line as you
would vi or emacs.  Steb supports multiple concurrent sessions,
and can create projects from directories automatically.
